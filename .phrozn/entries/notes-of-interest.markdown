# Notes

The forum was originally designed to run on a [mylittleforum ][mlf] 1.x database *at same time* as [mylittleforum][mlf]. If you encounter WTF: consider if it makes sense in that context … and then fix it!

Currently it's only running at and therefor is still partly customized for [macnemo.de][macnemo].

So, there are some quirks (and a dragon – his name is WTF) in it.
